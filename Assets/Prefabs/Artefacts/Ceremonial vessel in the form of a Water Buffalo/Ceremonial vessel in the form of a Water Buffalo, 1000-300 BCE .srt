00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,059
Ceremonial Vessel in the Form
of a Water Buffalo, 1000-300

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,799
BCE. Among the first
domesticated animals in

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,599
Thailand, the water buffalo
was instrumental to the

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,459
plowing of rice fields and
also a likely symbol of

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,809
abundance for the afterlife.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,179
These three vessels, including
an exceptionally large one in

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,879
the form of a water buffalo,
were found as a group in

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,499
graves, where they had been
smashed as offerings over

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,769
the bodies of the deceased.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,499
Now reconstructed, they
present important developments

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,259
from the earlier ceramics
seen at left, with their

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,539
use of multiple colors on
a single vessel, incised

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,319
and rope-marked patterns
for surface texture, and

14
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,089
inventive forms gracefully
standing on several feet.
