  Title: Celestial Horse
  Year: 25-220 CE
  Origin: China
  Material: Bronze with traces of polychrome
  Description: "Chinese government envoys sent to central Asia returned to court
    marveling over a breed of \u201Cheavenly horse\u201D like no other, a stout animal
    with powerful back and shoulders that worked so hard it sweated blood. The Chinese
    emperor Wu (r. 141\u201387 BCE) became obsessed with these stories and dispatched
    diplomats and later a military force to obtain the horses. His interest in these
    remarkable horses and the growing role horses played in military campaigns largely
    account for the popularity of the horse in art from the Han dynasty, in particular
    the era in which Wu ruled. Bronze horses such as this one were placed in elaborately
    furnished aristocratic tombs and were meant to provide transportation for the
    deceased in the afterlife. This spirited horse, a blend of ideal and real in
    its modeling, captures the spirit of the fabled \u201Ccelestial horses\u201D
    of the Han dynasty."
