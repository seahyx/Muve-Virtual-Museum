  Title: Prestige stool (Kuo fo)
  Year: 
  Origin: Bamileke makers, Cameroon
  Material: Wood, cotton, plant fiber, glass beads, and indigo
  Description: "Did You Know? The beads on this stool were sewn on by hand. Look
    underneath the stool, however, and you can see commercially made printed fabric.\r\nBead-covered
    wooden stools and thrones are one of the most prevalent art forms among the various
    kingdoms and chiefdoms in the Cameroon Grassfields region. This example, once
    part of the royal treasury, belongs in the category of \"\"travel stools,\"\"
    usually used in conjunction with more private, minor ceremonies and rituals at
    the palace. The leopard imagery confirms the object\u2019s royal status. It alludes
    to the belief that the king could temporarily transform himself into this feared
    predator."
