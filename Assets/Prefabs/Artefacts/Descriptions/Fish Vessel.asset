  Title: Vessel in the Form of a Fish
  Year: c. 100 BCE - 600 CE
  Origin: Nasca Artists, Peru
  Material: Clay, Pigments
  Description: Nazca artists are known for their bold, colorful designs. Although
    they were acute observers of the world around them and depicted many plants and
    animals in their work, they seemed concerned less with naturalism than with capturing
    the spirit and liveliness of their subject matter. This fish is highly stylized,
    with scales suggested by brush strokes, and gills through sweeping lines. It
    is rounded and fat, attesting to flush times and an abundance of food. Fish were
    a key component of the Nazca diet and were often shown in their art.
