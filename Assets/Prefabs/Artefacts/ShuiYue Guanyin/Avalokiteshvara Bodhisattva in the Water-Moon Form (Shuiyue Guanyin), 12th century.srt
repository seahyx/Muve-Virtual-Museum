00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,239
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva
in the Watermoon Form, Shuiyue

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,399
Guanyin, 12th century. Of the
many manifestations of the

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,399
Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara,
perhaps none was more

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,799
prevalent in East Asia
than the uniquely Chinese

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,639
form known as Watermoon
Avalokiteshvara, which

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,769
later also spread
to Korea and Japan.

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,219
This form of the Bodhisattva
presides over his own

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,618
paradise, Patalaka, which
is described in scripture as

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,478
a rugged seaside cave from
which Avalokiteshvara could

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,509
admire the reflection of
the moon in the water.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,579
Appropriately, he appears
meditative and relaxed and

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,849
is seated informally in
the royal-ease posture.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,439
Ornately dressed, with silk
robes, fluttering sashes,

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,599
jewelry, and an elaborate
hairstyle, he also wears a

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,279
headpiece that features an
image of Amitābha, the Buddha

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,129
to whom Avalokiteshvara
attends.

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,719
Believers might look to a
sculpture like this as a

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,889
guide for their own journeys
toward enlightenment.
