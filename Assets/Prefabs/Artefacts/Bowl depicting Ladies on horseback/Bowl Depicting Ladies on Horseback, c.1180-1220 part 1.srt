1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,369
Bowl depicting ladies on
horseback c.1180-1220.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,139
These bowls date from the
Seljuq period in Iran,

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,869
around 1100 or 1200.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,379
The Seljuqs were familial
clans who invaded Iran

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,769
from the Asian steppe.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,579
Although not Muslim, the
Seljuqs quickly assimilated

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,049
to the Islamic culture of
their conquered peoples.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,839
Under the Seljuqs, the
centers of power shifted from

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,029
Baghdad in Iraq to what is
modern-day Turkey and Iran.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,139
These bowls illustrate
the silhouette effect

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,729
popular in Seljuk art.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,839
Decoration is applied directly
to the pot, painted in a

13
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,809
black slip and covered with
a clear or colored glaze.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,279
This technique allows the
human figures to stand

15
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,969
out against either a busy
or a blank background.

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,039
These scenes and other figural
designs were often taken

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,869
from Iranian epic hero poems.

18
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,219
Another important feature
of these bowls is the

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,369
Arabic script that
adorns the outer rim.
