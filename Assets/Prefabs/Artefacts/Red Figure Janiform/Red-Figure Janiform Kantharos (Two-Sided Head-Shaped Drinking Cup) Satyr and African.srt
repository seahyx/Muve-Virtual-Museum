Combining two mold-made faces
beneath a pair of vertical

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:11,919
handles and a flaring,
wheel-made lip, this unusual

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,799
drinking cup is a variation
of the Kantharos, a

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,069
vessel favored by the
wine god Dionysus.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,258
A snub nose and equine
ears identify the satyr,

a relatively common

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,359
more unusual, apparently meant
to show an older African man,

00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,329
with white beard and eyebrows,
and wrinkles around the eyes.
