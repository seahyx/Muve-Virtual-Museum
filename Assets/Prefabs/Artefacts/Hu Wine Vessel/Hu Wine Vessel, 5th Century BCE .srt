00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,619
This storage vessel is
one of an important group

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,609
of hunting-scene hu.

4
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,639
They show the influence
of the nomadic art of

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,909
China's northern frontier.

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,439
The four major bands depict
men hunting birds, deer,

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,009

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,129
a revolutionary
departure in bronze art.

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,219
Previously, during the Shang
and Zhou periods, sacred

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,299
symbols and stylized animals
were formally arranged

00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,749
with regard to hierarchy
and strict symmetry.
