1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,549
Saint Martin and the
Beggar, circa 1375-85.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,299
This newly discovered panel
painting was a compartment

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,549
of a larger Spanish
Gothic altarpiece.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,179
It was made in the flourishing
workshop of the brothers Jaume

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,789
and Pere Serra, in Barcelona.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,809
It represents Saint
Martin, Bishop of Tours,

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,699
c. 315-397, who as a young
man had served in the

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,749
Roman army in Gaul.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,298
One cold winter night, he came
upon a man bare and shivering,

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,409
and he cut his cloak
in half, to share it.

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,199
After this act of charity,
Christ appeared to Martin in

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,359
a dream, wearing the cloak,
and said, "What thou hast

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,889
done for that poor man,
thou hast done for me."

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,039
The painting's monumental
scale, refined coloring, and

15
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,639
expressive figures reflect the
influence of Italian painting,

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,959
particularly Sienese painting,
of which a number of examples

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,029
are displayed nearby.
