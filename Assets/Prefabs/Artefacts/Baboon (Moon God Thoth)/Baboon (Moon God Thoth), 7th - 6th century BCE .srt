00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,539
Baboon, Moon God Thoth,
7th - 6th century BCE.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,409
Monkeys were kept as costly
pets by the elite in ancient

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,949
Egypt, yet their regal
appearance and imposing

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,689
presence also made them
useful representations of

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,139
gods in the Egyptian religion.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,789
The baboon was usually
associated with Thoth,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,719
one of the moon gods.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,089
This animal has a hole in
the crown that once held

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,929
a lunar disk sitting on
top of a crescent moon,

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,019
an attribute of Thoth.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,269
For a 2,600-year-old artwork
it is in remarkable condition,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,349
and though the animal is
small in size, its posture and

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,619
expression command authority.
