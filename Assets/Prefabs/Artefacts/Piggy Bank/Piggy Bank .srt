1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,589
Piggy bank.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,749
Do I look familiar to you?

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,879
My round and exaggerated form
makes me perfect for storing

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,359
precious coins, which could
be inserted through the

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,009
slot, now closed, on
the hump of my back.

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,499
My fierce expression is a
warning to scare off any

7
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,258
burglars, and the padlock
and chain around my neck

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,449
indicate my function
as a personal bank.

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,579
Yes, I am a piggy bank, a
lucky one that has survived

10
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,609
intact for over 500 years.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,429
Usually we end broken by
people who want our coins.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,639
The word for piggy bank in
Eastern Java is tjèlèngan,

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,509
meaning wild boar.
