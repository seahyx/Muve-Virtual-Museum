Yamantaka Mandala, 1991.
A mandala is a visual

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,479
representation of the sacred
Buddhist universe, which

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,089
is used in meditation
and initiation rites.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,819
The creation of a mandala
is believed to benefit all

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,039
beings, and the time and space
it requires is consecrated

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,749
through prayer, ritual
music, and performance.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,818
A team of monks-in-residence
created this colored sand

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,929
mandala at the museum in 1991
over a period of four weeks.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,679
While sand mandalas are
intended to be ephemeral,

10
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,899
the MIA preserved it in order
to honor the 1.2 million

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,499
Tibetans who lost their
lives to political-religious

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,529
persecution during
the 20th century.

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,179
The museum thanks the Tibetan
American Foundation of

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,079
Minnesota for bringing the
Gyuto monks to Minnesota and

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,589
for their efforts to preserve
Tibetan cultural traditions.
