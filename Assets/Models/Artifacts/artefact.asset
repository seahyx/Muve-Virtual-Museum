  Title: Yamantaka Mandala
  Year: 1991
  Origin: Monks of the Gyuto Tantric University
  Material: Colored silicate and adhesive on wood
  Description: 'A mandala is a visual representation of the sacred Buddhist universe,
    which is used in meditation and initiation rites. The creation of a mandala is
    believed to benefit all beings, and the time and space it requires is consecrated
    through prayer, ritual music, and performance.

    A team of monks-in residence
    created this colored sand mandala at the museum in 1991 over a period of four
    weeks. While sand mandalas are intended to be ephemeral, the MIA preserved it
    in order to honor the 1.2 million Tibetans who lost their lives to political-religious
    persecution during the 20th century.

    The museum thanks the Tibetan American
    Foundation of Minnesota for bringing the Gyuto monks to Minnesota and for their
    efforts to preserve Tibetan cultural traditions.'
