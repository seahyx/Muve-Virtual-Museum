Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva in the Water-Moon Form (Shuiyue Guanyin),12th century,"Unknown artist, China","Wood, gesso and pigments","Of the many manifestations of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, perhaps none was more prevalent in East Asia than the uniquely Chinese form known as “Water-Moon Avalokiteshvara,” which later also spread to Korea and Japan. This form of the bodhisattva presides over his own paradise, Potolaka, which is described in scripture as a rugged seaside cave from which Avalokiteshvara could admire the reflection of the moon in the water. Appropriately, he appears meditative and relaxed and is seated informally in the “royal-ease” posture. Ornately dressed, with silk robes, fluttering sashes, jewelry, and an elaborate hairstyle, he also wears a headpiece that features an image of Amitābha, the buddha to whom Avalokiteshvara attends. Believers might look to a sculpture like this as a guide for their own journeys toward enlightenment.",,Yes,Shuiyue Guanyin
Yamantaka Mandala,1991,Monks of the Gyuto Tantric University,Colored silicate and adhesive on wood,"A mandala is a visual representation of the sacred Buddhist universe, which is used in meditation and initiation rites. The creation of a mandala is believed to benefit all beings, and the time and space it requires is consecrated through prayer, ritual music, and performance.
A team of monks-in residence created this colored sand mandala at the museum in 1991 over a period of four weeks. While sand mandalas are intended to be ephemeral, the MIA preserved it in order to honor the 1.2 million Tibetans who lost their lives to political-religious persecution during the 20th century.
The museum thanks the Tibetan American Foundation of Minnesota for bringing the Gyuto monks to Minnesota and for their efforts to preserve Tibetan cultural traditions.",,Yes,Yamantaka Mandala
Vessel in the Form of a Fish,c. 100 BCE - 600 CE,"Nasca Artists, Peru","Clay, Pigments","Nazca artists are known for their bold, colorful designs. Although they were acute observers of the world around them and depicted many plants and animals in their work, they seemed concerned less with naturalism than with capturing the spirit and liveliness of their subject matter. This fish is highly stylized, with scales suggested by brush strokes, and gills through sweeping lines. It is rounded and fat, attesting to flush times and an abundance of food. Fish were a key component of the Nazca diet and were often shown in their art.",,Yes,Fish Vessel
Vase,18th century,"Unknown Artist, China","Enamel, copper alloy","This vase derives from the bronze hu vessel but is made in cloisonné. The cloisonné technique reached China from Byzantium (present-day Istanbul) between 1200 and 1400 CE, but Chinese artisans made it their own. The general stylistic trend was toward bigger, more complicated and luxurious creations. During the Qing dynasty reigns of emperors Kangxi (r. 1662–1722) and Qianlong (r. 1736–95), cloisonné was perfected and reached its artistic summit. Colors were more delicate, and filigrees more flexible and fluent. Previously used for religious paraphernalia, cloisonné now embellished secular objects. This vase is a typical product of the 1700s. Supported on a straight foot ring, the globular body rises to a long, cylindrical neck and terminates in a lipped rim. The vase is decorated in colored enamels on a turquoise ground. Surrounding the neck are upright leaves; below on the shoulder is a band of interlocking Ts. Farther down is an elaborate band of cloud patterns, each resembling the head of a ruyi scepter, and a narrow frieze of small lotus scrolls. The main body, below a band of C-scrolls, is decorated with scrolling, stylized lotuses. The foot, base, and mouth rim are gilt.",,Yes,Vase
Hu Wine Vessel,5th Century BCE,"Unknown Artist, China",Bronze,"This storage vessel is one of an important group of hunting-scene hu. They show the influence of the nomadic art of China’s northern frontier. The four major bands depict men hunting birds, deer, boars, and tigers with spears, knives, and bows. Panels on the vessel’s shoulders show an archer shooting from the back of a four-horse chariot with driver. These pictorial scenes of human activity represent a revolutionary departure in bronze art. Previously, during the Shang and Zhou periods, sacred symbols and stylized animals were formally arranged with regard to hierarchy and strict symmetry. The subject here appears secular rather than religious.",,Yes,Hu Wine Vessel
"Winged dragon, one of a pair",5th-4th century BCE,"Unknown artist, China",Bronze,"The sculptural quality of these dashing beasts is conveyed by their stances, the proud carriage of their heads, and the apparent agility of their bodies. The forceful comma-shaped tails and their jaunty tufts, as well as the double-rope patterns on the moustaches, are typical elements of Warring States period art.",,Yes,Winged Dragon
Shōki capturing a demon with a hat,19th century,"Harumitsu, Japan",Ivory,"This is an ivory netsuke depicting Shōki, a figure in Chinese and Japanese mythology. Traditionally regarded as a vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings, and reputedly able to command 80,000 demons, his image is often painted on household gates as a guardian spirit, as well as in places of business where high-value goods are involved.",,Yes,Shoki
Baboon (Moon God Thoth),7th - 6th century BCE,Egypt,Faience,"Monkeys were kept as costly pets by the elite in ancient Egypt, yet their regal appearance and imposing presence also made them useful representations of gods in the Egyptian religion. The baboon was usually associated with Thoth, one of the moon gods. This animal has a hole in the crown that once held a lunar disk sitting on top of a crescent moon, an attribute of Thoth. For a 2,600-year-old artwork it is in remarkable condition, and though the animal is small in size, its posture and expression command authority.",,Yes,Baboon
Celestial Horse,25-220 CE,China,Bronze with traces of polychrome,"Chinese government envoys sent to central Asia returned to court marveling over a breed of “heavenly horse” like no other, a stout animal with powerful back and shoulders that worked so hard it sweated blood. The Chinese emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) became obsessed with these stories and dispatched diplomats and later a military force to obtain the horses. His interest in these remarkable horses and the growing role horses played in military campaigns largely account for the popularity of the horse in art from the Han dynasty, in particular the era in which Wu ruled. Bronze horses such as this one were placed in elaborately furnished aristocratic tombs and were meant to provide transportation for the deceased in the afterlife. This spirited horse, a blend of ideal and real in its modeling, captures the spirit of the fabled “celestial horses” of the Han dynasty.",,Yes,Celestial Horse
Ceremonial vessel in the form of a Water Buffalo,1000-300 BCE,Unknown Artist,Earthenware with impressed designs,"Among the first domesticated animals in Thailand, the water buffalo was instrumental to the plowing of rice fields and also a likely symbol of abundance for the afterlife. These three vessels, including an exceptionally large one in the form of a water buffalo, were found as a group in graves, where they had been smashed as offerings over the bodies of the deceased. Now reconstructed, they present important developments from the earlier ceramics seen at left, with their use of multiple colors on a single vessel, incised and rope-marked patterns for surface texture, and inventive forms gracefully standing on several feet.",,Yes,Water Buffalo
Bowl Depicting Ladies on Horseback,c.1180-1220,Iran,"Earthenware with overglaze polychrome colors, Mina'i ware","These bowls date from the Seljuk period in Iran, around 1,100 or 1,200. The Seljuks were familial clans who invaded Iran from the Asian Step. Although not Muslim, the Seljuks quickly assimilated to the Islamic culture of their conquered peoples. Under the Seljuks, the centers of power shifted from Baghdad in Iraq to what is modern-day Turkey and Iran. These bowls illustrate the silhouette effect popular in Seljuk art. Decoration is applied directly to the pot, painted in a black slip and covered with a clear or colored glaze. This technique allows the human figures to stand out against either a busy or a blank background. These scenes and other figural designs were often taken from Iranian epic hero poems. Another important feature of these bowls is the Arabic script that adorns the outer rim. Bend down and take a look underneath the rim. The writing is a crude, kufik script, and each bowl's script looks different, suggesting that these three bowls are from different artists, each with a different level of comfort, writing in Arabic.",,Yes,Ladies on Horseback Bowl
Olive Trees,1889,Vincent van Gogh,Oil on canvas,"This is one of fifteen canvases of olive trees that van Gogh executed between June and December of 1889. Earlier that year he had interned himself in the asylum of St-Paul, in the town of St-Rémy in southern France, where he would create his most profound works. The vibrant oranges and yellows suggest that the picture dates to the autumn months. Van Gogh left St-Rémy in May 1890, moving to Auvers, near Paris, where he continued to paint until his death by suicide in July.",,Yes,Olive Tree Painting
The Dunes at Camiers,1871,Charles-François Daubigny,Oil on canvas,"Camiers is a small town on the coast of northwestern France. Daubigny is known for sketching directly on his canvas, adding layers of paint to create the final product. This sketch aesthetic is what helped bring about the Impressionist movement.",,Yes,The Dunes at Camiers
Brook in Winter,1914,"E. Ambrose Webster, United States",Oil on canvas,"E. Ambrose Webster was thrilled by the effects of light and was an attentive observer of nature. He was an influential teacher and spent a great deal of time as part of the Provincetown art colony, working in the open air among other artists and younger students. He was considered a leading modernist in American during the 1910s and exhibited in the Armory Show, a massive 1913 exhibition that introduced modern European artists to Americans in a large number. Brook in Winter shows Webster’s careful observation of sunset effects on a winter day. He added slashes of purple and searing orange through the trees to give the feeling of the long rays of the sun transformed through the brittle forest.",,Yes,Brook in Winter
Saint Martin and the Beggar,c. 1375-85,"Jaume Serra; Artist: Pere Serra, Spain",Oil on canvas,"This newly discovered panel painting was a compartment of a larger Spanish Gothic altarpiece. It was made in the flourishing workshop of the brothers Jaume and Pere Serra in Barcelona. It represents Saint Martin, Bishop of Tours (c. 315–397), who as a young man had served in the Roman army in Gaul. One cold winter night, he came upon a man bare and shivering, and he cut his cloak in half to share it. After this act of charity, Christ appeared to Martin in a dream—wearing the cloak—and said, ""What thou hast done for that poor man, thou hast done for me."" The painting’s monumental scale, refined coloring, and expressive figures reflect the influence of Italian painting, particularly Sienese painting, of which a number of examples are displayed nearby.",,Yes,Saint Martin and the Beggar
Scenes in and around Kyoto,early 17th century,"Unknown Japanese, Japan","Ink, color, and gold on paper","This screen shows a bird’s-eye view of the city of Kyoto, the capital of Japan for most of its early history. Many famous sites of Kyoto are pictured. To orient yourself, look for the river that emerges in the middle of the far right panel and then flows to the upper left. This is the Kamo River, which flows north-south and bisects the city. It is crossed by several bridges—the Fifth Avenue Bridge, visible in the second panel from the right, and the Third Avenue Bridge, in the upper part of the fourth panel from the right. 

At the very top of the second and third panels from the right is the famous Buddhist temple Kiyomizudera, with its long staircase and high veranda. A group of people gather there to admire blooming cherry trees below. At the far upper left of the screen, look for Kamigamo Shrine near which an annual horse race is taking place. In the middle panels, you can see a variety of large, colorful carts—floats for the annual Gion Festival Parade. Also look for a group of men near the bottom of the second panel from the left. They wear decidedly non-Japanese clothing and carry banners with white Christian crosses. Groups of locals gather in the upper floors of buildings to examine these curious visitors, perhaps Portuguese, moving through the streets of Japan’s ancient capital.",,Yes,Scenes in and around Kyoto
Moai Kavakava,19th century,Rapa Nui,Wood,"A mo‘ai kavakava is a small wooden figure of a style originated by the Rapa Nui culture of Easter Island. 
Each figure resembles a standing, slightly stooped, male human with an emaciated body.
The name mo‘ai kavakava is formed from mo‘ai for the monumental monolithic human figures found on Easter Island and the word kavakava meaning ribs. Little is known about the cultural context of these figures although they are generally considered to be representations of starving ancestors or demons. 19th century travelers reported that these figures were worn hanging around the necks of men who took part in the ritual dances during public ceremonies.",,Yes,Moai Kava
Prestige stool (Kuo fo),,"Bamileke makers, Cameroon","Wood, cotton, plant fiber, glass beads, and indigo","Did You Know? The beads on this stool were sewn on by hand. Look underneath the stool, however, and you can see commercially made printed fabric.
Bead-covered wooden stools and thrones are one of the most prevalent art forms among the various kingdoms and chiefdoms in the Cameroon Grassfields region. This example, once part of the royal treasury, belongs in the category of ""travel stools,"" usually used in conjunction with more private, minor ceremonies and rituals at the palace. The leopard imagery confirms the object’s royal status. It alludes to the belief that the king could temporarily transform himself into this feared predator.",,Yes,Prestige Stool
Red-Figure Janiform Kantharos (Two-Sided Head-Shaped Drinking Cup): Satyr and African,,"Class K, Attic vase painters",Ceramic,"Combining two mold-made faces beneath a pair of vertical handles and a flaring, wheel-made lip, this unusual drinking cup is a variation of the kantharos, a vessel favored by the wine god Dionysos. A snub nose and equine ears identify the satyr, a relatively common type on such vessels. The glossy black face and red hair on the other side are more unusual, apparently meant to show an older African man, with white beard and eyebrows, and wrinkles around the eyes.",,Yes,Red-Figure Janiform Kantharos
Garniture Set (one clock and 2 vases),c.1736,Unknown Artist,"Chinese hard-paste porcelain, gilt bronze, enameled metal","Did You Know?
A set of vases and clock, connected visually by the use of the same materials, often adorned a mantlepiece or the top of a large piece of furniture, such as a commode or console, within a room.
Description
The fascination with Chinese porcelain among aristocratic circles increased during the reign of Louis XV. In reaction to the perceived excesses of elaborate naturalistic ornament of the 1750s, mount makers increasingly turned to neoclassical designs, known as Goût Grec (Greek taste) in the 1760s and 1770s. These beautifully chased gilt-bronze mounts feature classical Greco-Roman motifs such as lion masks, acanthus and laurel leaves, and pilasters.",,Yes,Garniture Set
Piggy Bank,,"Majapahit Dynasty, Java, Indonesia",Terracotta,"Do I look familiar to you? My round and exaggerated form makes me perfect for storing precious coins, which could be inserted through the slot (now closed) on the hump of my back. My fierce expression is a warning to scare off any burglars, and the padlock and chain around my neck indicate my function as a personal bank. Yes, I am a piggy bank—a lucky one that has survived intact for over 500 years! Usually we end up broken by people who want our coins. The word for piggy bank in Eastern Java is tjèlèngan, meaning ‘wild boar.",,Yes,Piggy Bank
