  Description: "Do I look familiar to you? My round and exaggerated form makes me
    perfect for storing precious coins, which could be inserted through the slot
    (now closed) on the hump of my back. My fierce expression is a warning to scare
    off any burglars, and the padlock and chain around my neck indicate my function
    as a personal bank. Yes, I am a piggy bank\u2014a lucky one that has survived
    intact for over 500 years! Usually we end up broken by people who want our coins.
    The word for piggy bank in Eastern Java is tj\xE8l\xE8ngan, meaning \u2018wild
    boar."
