  Title: 'Red-Figure Janiform Kantharos (Two-Sided Head-Shaped Drinking Cup): Satyr
    and African'
  Year: 
  Origin: Class K, Attic vase painters
  Material: Ceramic
  Description: Combining two mold-made faces beneath a pair of vertical handles and
    a flaring, wheel-made lip, this unusual drinking cup is a variation of the kantharos,
    a vessel favored by the wine god Dionysos. A snub nose and equine ears identify
    the satyr, a relatively common type on such vessels. The glossy black face and
    red hair on the other side are more unusual, apparently meant to show an older
    African man, with white beard and eyebrows, and wrinkles around the eyes.
