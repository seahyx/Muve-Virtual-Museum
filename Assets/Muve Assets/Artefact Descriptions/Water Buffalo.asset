  Title: Ceremonial vessel in the form of a Water Buffalo
  Year: 1000-300 BCE
  Origin: Unknown Artist
  Material: Earthenware with impressed designs
  Description: Among the first domesticated animals in Thailand, the water buffalo
    was instrumental to the plowing of rice fields and also a likely symbol of abundance
    for the afterlife. These three vessels, including an exceptionally large one
    in the form of a water buffalo, were found as a group in graves, where they had
    been smashed as offerings over the bodies of the deceased. Now reconstructed,
    they present important developments from the earlier ceramics seen at left, with
    their use of multiple colors on a single vessel, incised and rope-marked patterns
    for surface texture, and inventive forms gracefully standing on several feet.
