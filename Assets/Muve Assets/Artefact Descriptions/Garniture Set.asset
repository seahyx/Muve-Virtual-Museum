  Title: Garniture Set (one clock and 2 vases)
  Year: c.1736
  Origin: Unknown Artist
  Material: Chinese hard-paste porcelain, gilt bronze, enameled metal
  Description: "Did You Know?\r\nA set of vases and clock, connected visually by
    the use of the same materials, often adorned a mantlepiece or the top of a large
    piece of furniture, such as a commode or console, within a room.\r\nDescription\r\nThe
    fascination with Chinese porcelain among aristocratic circles increased during
    the reign of Louis XV. In reaction to the perceived excesses of elaborate naturalistic
    ornament of the 1750s, mount makers increasingly turned to neoclassical designs,
    known as Go\xFBt Grec (Greek taste) in the 1760s and 1770s. These beautifully
    chased gilt-bronze mounts feature classical Greco-Roman motifs such as lion masks,
    acanthus and laurel leaves, and pilasters."
