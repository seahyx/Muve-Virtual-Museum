  Title: Olive Trees
  Year: 1889
  Origin: Vincent van Gogh
  Material: Oil on canvas
  Description: "This is one of fifteen canvases of olive trees that van Gogh executed
    between June and December of 1889. Earlier that year he had interned himself
    in the asylum of St-Paul, in the town of St-R\xE9my in southern France, where
    he would create his most profound works. The vibrant oranges and yellows suggest
    that the picture dates to the autumn months. Van Gogh left St-R\xE9my in May
    1890, moving to Auvers, near Paris, where he continued to paint until his death
    by suicide in July."
