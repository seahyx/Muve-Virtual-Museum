  Title: Moai Kavakava
  Year: 19th century
  Origin: Rapa Nui
  Material: Wood
  Description: "A mo\u2018ai kavakava is a small wooden figure of a style originated
    by the Rapa Nui culture of Easter Island. \r\nEach figure resembles a standing,
    slightly stooped, male human with an emaciated body.\r\nThe name mo\u2018ai kavakava
    is formed from mo\u2018ai for the monumental monolithic human figures found on
    Easter Island and the word kavakava meaning ribs. Little is known about the cultural
    context of these figures although they are generally considered to be representations
    of starving ancestors or demons. 19th century travelers reported that these figures
    were worn hanging around the necks of men who took part in the ritual dances
    during public ceremonies."
