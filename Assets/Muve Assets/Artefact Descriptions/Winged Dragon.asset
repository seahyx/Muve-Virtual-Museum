  Title: Winged dragon, one of a pair
  Year: 5th-4th century BCE
  Origin: Unknown artist, China
  Material: Bronze
  Description: The sculptural quality of these dashing beasts is conveyed by their
    stances, the proud carriage of their heads, and the apparent agility of their
    bodies. The forceful comma-shaped tails and their jaunty tufts, as well as the
    double-rope patterns on the moustaches, are typical elements of Warring States
    period art.
