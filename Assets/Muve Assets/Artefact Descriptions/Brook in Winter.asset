  Title: Brook in Winter
  Year: 1914
  Origin: E. Ambrose Webster, United States
  Material: Oil on canvas
  Description: "E. Ambrose Webster was thrilled by the effects of light and was an
    attentive observer of nature. He was an influential teacher and spent a great
    deal of time as part of the Provincetown art colony, working in the open air
    among other artists and younger students. He was considered a leading modernist
    in American during the 1910s and exhibited in the Armory Show, a massive 1913
    exhibition that introduced modern European artists to Americans in a large number.
    Brook in Winter shows Webster\u2019s careful observation of sunset effects on
    a winter day. He added slashes of purple and searing orange through the trees
    to give the feeling of the long rays of the sun transformed through the brittle
    forest."
