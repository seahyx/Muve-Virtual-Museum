  Title: Bowl Depicting Ladies on Horseback
  Year: c.1180-1220
  Origin: Iran
  Material: Earthenware with overglaze polychrome colors, Mina'i ware
  Description: These bowls date from the Seljuk period in Iran, around 1,100 or 1,200.
    The Seljuks were familial clans who invaded Iran from the Asian Step. Although
    not Muslim, the Seljuks quickly assimilated to the Islamic culture of their conquered
    peoples. Under the Seljuks, the centers of power shifted from Baghdad in Iraq
    to what is modern-day Turkey and Iran. These bowls illustrate the silhouette
    effect popular in Seljuk art. Decoration is applied directly to the pot, painted
    in a black slip and covered with a clear or colored glaze. This technique allows
    the human figures to stand out against either a busy or a blank background. These
    scenes and other figural designs were often taken from Iranian epic hero poems.
    Another important feature of these bowls is the Arabic script that adorns the
    outer rim. Bend down and take a look underneath the rim. The writing is a crude,
    kufik script, and each bowl's script looks different, suggesting that these three
    bowls are from different artists, each with a different level of comfort, writing
    in Arabic.
