  Title: Saint Martin and the Beggar
  Year: c. 1375-85
  Origin: 'Jaume Serra; Artist: Pere Serra, Spain'
  Material: Oil on canvas
  Description: "This newly discovered panel painting was a compartment of a larger
    Spanish Gothic altarpiece. It was made in the flourishing workshop of the brothers
    Jaume and Pere Serra in Barcelona. It represents Saint Martin, Bishop of Tours
    (c. 315\u2013397), who as a young man had served in the Roman army in Gaul. One
    cold winter night, he came upon a man bare and shivering, and he cut his cloak
    in half to share it. After this act of charity, Christ appeared to Martin in
    a dream\u2014wearing the cloak\u2014and said, \"\"What thou hast done for that
    poor man, thou hast done for me.\"\" The painting\u2019s monumental scale, refined
    coloring, and expressive figures reflect the influence of Italian painting, particularly
    Sienese painting, of which a number of examples are displayed nearby."
  MiniGameDescription: What thou hast done for that poor man, thou hast done for
