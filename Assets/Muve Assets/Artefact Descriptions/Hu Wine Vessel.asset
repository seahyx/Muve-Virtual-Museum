  Title: Hu Wine Vessel
  Year: 5th Century BCE
  Origin: Unknown Artist, China
  Material: Bronze
  Description: "This storage vessel is one of an important group of hunting-scene
    hu. They show the influence of the nomadic art of China\u2019s northern frontier.
    The four major bands depict men hunting birds, deer, boars, and tigers with spears,
    knives, and bows. Panels on the vessel\u2019s shoulders show an archer shooting
    from the back of a four-horse chariot with driver. These pictorial scenes of
    human activity represent a revolutionary departure in bronze art. Previously,
    during the Shang and Zhou periods, sacred symbols and stylized animals were formally
    arranged with regard to hierarchy and strict symmetry. The subject here appears
    secular rather than religious."
