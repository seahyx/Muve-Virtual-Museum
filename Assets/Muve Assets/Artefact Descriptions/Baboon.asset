  Title: "Baboon\_(Moon God Thoth)"
  Year: 7th - 6th century BCE
  Origin: Egypt
  Material: Faience
  Description: Monkeys were kept as costly pets by the elite in ancient Egypt, yet
    their regal appearance and imposing presence also made them useful representations
    of gods in the Egyptian religion. The baboon was usually associated with Thoth,
    one of the moon gods. This animal has a hole in the crown that once held a lunar
    disk sitting on top of a crescent moon, an attribute of Thoth. For a 2,600-year-old
    artwork it is in remarkable condition, and though the animal is small in size,
    its posture and expression command authority.
