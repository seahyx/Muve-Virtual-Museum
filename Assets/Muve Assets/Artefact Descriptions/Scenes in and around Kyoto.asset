  Title: Scenes in and around Kyoto
  Year: early 17th century
  Origin: Unknown Japanese, Japan
  Material: Ink, color, and gold on paper
  Description: "This screen shows a bird\u2019s-eye view of the city of Kyoto, the
    capital of Japan for most of its early history. Many famous sites of Kyoto are
    pictured. To orient yourself, look for the river that emerges in the middle of
    the far right panel and then flows to the upper left. This is the Kamo River,
    which flows north-south and bisects the city. It is crossed by several bridges\u2014the
    Fifth Avenue Bridge, visible in the second panel from the right, and the Third
    Avenue Bridge, in the upper part of the fourth panel from the right. \r\n\r\nAt
    the very top of the second and third panels from the right is the famous Buddhist
    temple Kiyomizudera, with its long staircase and high veranda. A group of people
    gather there to admire blooming cherry trees below. At the far upper left of
    the screen, look for Kamigamo Shrine near which an annual horse race is taking
    place. In the middle panels, you can see a variety of large, colorful carts\u2014floats
    for the annual Gion Festival Parade. Also look for a group of men near the bottom
    of the second panel from the left. They wear decidedly non-Japanese clothing
    and carry banners with white Christian crosses. Groups of locals gather in the
    upper floors of buildings to examine these curious visitors, perhaps Portuguese,
    moving through the streets of Japan\u2019s ancient capital."
