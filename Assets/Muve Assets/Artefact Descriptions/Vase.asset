  Title: Vase
  Year: 18th century
  Origin: Unknown Artist, China
  Material: Enamel, copper alloy
  Description: "This vase derives from the bronze hu vessel but is made in cloisonn\xE9.
    The cloisonn\xE9 technique reached China from Byzantium (present-day Istanbul)
    between 1200 and 1400 CE, but Chinese artisans made it their own. The general
    stylistic trend was toward bigger, more complicated and luxurious creations.
    During the Qing dynasty reigns of emperors Kangxi (r. 1662\u20131722) and Qianlong
    (r. 1736\u201395), cloisonn\xE9 was perfected and reached its artistic summit.
    Colors were more delicate, and filigrees more flexible and fluent. Previously
    used for religious paraphernalia, cloisonn\xE9 now embellished secular objects.
    This vase is a typical product of the 1700s. Supported on a straight foot ring,
    the globular body rises to a long, cylindrical neck and terminates in a lipped
    rim. The vase is decorated in colored enamels on a turquoise ground. Surrounding
    the neck are upright leaves; below on the shoulder is a band of interlocking
    Ts. Farther down is an elaborate band of cloud patterns, each resembling the
    head of a ruyi scepter, and a narrow frieze of small lotus scrolls. The main
    body, below a band of C-scrolls, is decorated with scrolling, stylized lotuses.
    The foot, base, and mouth rim are gilt."
