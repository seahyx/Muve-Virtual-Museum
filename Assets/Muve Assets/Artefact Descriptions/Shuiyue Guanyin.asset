  Title: Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva in the Water-Moon Form (Shuiyue Guanyin)
  Year: 12th century
  Origin: Unknown artist, China
  Material: Wood, gesso and pigments
  Description: "Of the many manifestations of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, perhaps
    none was more prevalent in East Asia than the uniquely Chinese form known as
    \u201CWater-Moon Avalokiteshvara,\u201D which later also spread to Korea and
    Japan. This form of the bodhisattva presides over his own paradise, Potolaka,
    which is described in scripture as a rugged seaside cave from which Avalokiteshvara
    could admire the reflection of the moon in the water. Appropriately, he appears
    meditative and relaxed and is seated informally in the \u201Croyal-ease\u201D
    posture. Ornately dressed, with silk robes, fluttering sashes, jewelry, and an
    elaborate hairstyle, he also wears a headpiece that features an image of Amit\u0101bha,
    the buddha to whom Avalokiteshvara attends. Believers might look to a sculpture
    like this as a guide for their own journeys toward enlightenment."
